- `activeTab`: For accessing active tab data
- `scripting`: For executing scripts in tabs

## Security

FISABytes implements strict security measures:

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Secure cookie handling
- Protected storage mechanisms
- Input validation

## Testing and Quality Assurance

The project includes comprehensive testing and quality assurance tools:

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Initialize Husky for pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   npm run prepare
   ```

### Running Tests and Checks

- Run all tests:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- Run tests in watch mode:

  ```bash
  npm run test:watch
  ```

- Generate test coverage report:

  ```bash
  npm run test:coverage
  ```

- Run end-to-end tests:

  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```

- Run end-to-end tests in watch mode:

  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e:watch
  ```

- Run linting:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- Fix linting issues:

  ```bash
  npm run lint:fix
  ```

- Format code:

  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

- Type checking:

  ```bash
  npm run type-check
  ```

- Security checks:

  ```bash
  npm run security-check
  ```

- Generate documentation:
  ```bash
  npm run docs
  ```

### Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline runs:

- Type checking
- Linting
- Unit tests
- Security scans
- Documentation generation
- Build process

### Code Quality

- ESLint for code style and best practices
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- TypeScript for type safety
- Husky pre-commit hooks for automated checks
- Snyk for security vulnerability scanning

### Documentation

- TypeDoc for API documentation
- Automatically generated during CI/CD pipeline
- Available in the `docs` directory after running `npm run docs`

### End-to-End Testing

The project uses Puppeteer and Jest for end-to-end testing. E2E tests simulate real user interactions with the extension:

- Tests are located in `tests/e2e/`
- Test fixtures are in `tests/e2e/fixtures/`
- Tests run in a real Chrome instance with the extension loaded
- Supports testing popup, background page, and content scripts
- Includes custom matchers for common assertions

Example test scenarios:

- Cookie export/import functionality
- UI interactions and validations
- Error handling
- Cross-browser compatibility
