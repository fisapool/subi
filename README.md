   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `dist` directory

## Development

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
FISABytes/
├── src/
│   ├── core/           # Core application logic
│   ├── utils/          # Utility functions
│   └── tests/          # Test files
├── assets/             # Static assets
├── img/               # Image files
├── types/             # TypeScript type definitions
├── validation/        # Validation related code
├── security/          # Security related code
├── errors/            # Error handling
├── _locales/          # Internationalization files
├── manifest.json      # Extension manifest
├── popup.html         # Extension popup interface
└── service-worker-loader.js
```

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:
- `cookies`: For cookie management
- `storage`: For storing extension data
- `tabs`: For tab interaction
- `activeTab`: For accessing active tab data
- `scripting`: For executing scripts in tabs

## Security

FISABytes implements strict security measures:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Secure cookie handling
- Protected storage mechanisms
- Input validation
