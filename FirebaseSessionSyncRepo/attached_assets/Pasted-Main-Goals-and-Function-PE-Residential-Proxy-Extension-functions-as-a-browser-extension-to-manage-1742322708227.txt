Main Goals and Function

PE - Residential Proxy Extension functions as a browser extension to manage and use residential proxies. It supports SSE (Server-Sent Events) proxy servers and secure configuration and connection. The expansion emphasises ethical data collecting, secure connection management, input validation, and TOS and local legislation compliance.
